# Daniel Donaldson's submission

Static site, you can just clone or download and open index.html in your browser.
Vanilla JS and CSS, but assumed modern browser and so ES2015 used.

If you have questions, please contact me: d8nieldonaldson@gmail.com

Thanks, this was a fun assignment.


# Overview

Here at ShootProof, we prefer to have a good idea of a candidate's technical
experience before proceeding with our in-office interview portion of the
process.  We believe that the technical exercise below will illustrate a
candidate's approach to building reusable components using JavaScript and CSS.

# Guidelines

Goal: Create a navigable tree component using our provided set of test data.

The test data is a flat structure with parent ID pointers. You may choose to use
the data structure as-is, or have a function transform the data structure into
some other structure, but treat the test data as a given.

- This exercise should not take you more than three hours to complete
- Feel free to make this component as cool/interesting as you'd like, as long
  as it meets the technical requirements
- You may use a JavaScript framework of your choice, or no framework &mdash;
  the choice is up to you
- However, you must not rely on a module or library that already provides a
  similar tree component
- Your solution should be coded with reusability in mind
- Submit a working set of code (ZIP, tarball, or link to JSFiddle, Plunker,
  GitHub pull request, etc.)
  - A working, compiled set of code in a single directory that can be opened in a browser
  - All source code

# Technical Requirements

- A complete submission will:
  - Only show the expander UI element for nodes that contain children
  - Only turn the cursor into a pointer for nodes with children
  - Click a node to expand it
  - Use of a webfont (any font of your choice)
  - Text and icons should be vertically centered within each tree node
  - Images should have data-driven alt text shown on hover

The end result should look something similar to what's shown below:

# Test Data

You will find the test data in this repository under `testdata.json`. You can 
copy it into your code directly, or use HTTP to get the content of that data
directly from GitHub if you prefer.
